This archive contains the opacity table of Semenov et al. 2003 as a FORTRAN
77 code. The most important features of the model are overviewed in the
header of the code "opacity.f". In addition, an excessive description of its
structure as well as an information how to use it are given there. Enjoy!

PS. If you have any comments and/or suggestions, please contact me by E-mail.

The 'converter.py' script runs the opacity calculation tool several times and
assembles its output into a HDF5 file as a single function on the
lg(rho)-lg(T) grid.
